# XKCD Downloader

Experimenting with Bash - a script which pulls the latest XKCD comic and saves it as a PNG.

Requires json_pp if not already installed

## Usage
Make the script executable
```
chmod a+x xkcd.sh
```

Run it
```
./xkcd.sh
```

It will be saved like `1740-xkcd.png` with 1740 being the current comic number.
